    </li>
    <li>
      3.	The App is provided to You “as is”. We do not give any warranties that the App:

      <li>
        1.	The App stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the App secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the App won’t work properly or at all.
      </li>
      <li>
        2.	Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information on how we collect, use and disclose information from our users. You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Services is subject to our Privacy Policy.

      </li>
      <li>
        2.	You are entitled to perform actions, covered by the technical capabilities or logics of the App. 
      </li>
      <li>
        3.	You are entitled to inquire us with regard to defective App functioning (technical failures, etc.) if such defective functioning is not caused by your actions; peculiarities of hardware and software used by You; quality of the Internet connection; as well as other circumstances that "May play" is not responsible for.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>6	YOU MUST NOT:</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1.	examine the App source code, modify or amend it, create new works on its basis;
      </li>

      </li>
      <li>
        3.	make changes, dispose in any way or create derivative objects based on such content (whole or in part), unless such actions were directly authorized by "May play" of such content in accordance with the terms of separate agreement;
      </li>
      <li>
        4.	use the App in any way that interferes or may interfere with normal App functioning;
      </li>
      <li>
        5.	use bots (computer programs intended for performance of certain actions within the App for You), cheats (codes, embedded in the App for getting additional advantages within the App), as well as any other computer programs and/or technical means that interfere with normal App functioning and/or aimed at getting additional advantages within the App, which are not provided for by the logics or technical capabilities of the App;

      </li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>7	"MAY PLAY" IS ENTITLED TO:</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1.	limit the App functionality fully or partially at his sole discretion (including, but not limited to deleting the App from App Store). "May play" is not obliged to notify You of any limitation of functionality and is not liable for any damage caused to You as the result of limitation of the App functionality;
      </li>
      <li>
        2.	to change at his sole discretion any and all App parameters;
      </li>
      <li>
        3.	exercise other rights in accordance with Terms.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>8	RIGHTS AND CONTENT</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1.	"May play" is committed to ensuring that the App is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the App or to charge for its Services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the App or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
      </li>
      <li>
        2.	Certain functions of the App will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but "May play" cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
      </li>
      <li>
        3.	If you’re using the App outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the App, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the App. 
      </li>
      <li>
        4.	Along the same lines, "May play" cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the App i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, "May play" cannot accept responsibility.
      </li>
      <li>
        5.	With respect to May play’s responsibility for your use of the App, when you’re using the App, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. May play accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app. 
      </li>
      <li>
        6.	At some point, we may wish to update the App. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>9	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>1.	The App is a copyrighted work.</li>
      <li>2.	The copyright for the App belongs to the May play. All rights reserved.</li>
      <li>3.	The May play grants you a non-exclusive licence to use the App as intended (to download, install and run the App; to perform actions provided for by the technical capabilities and logics of the App);</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>10	CHANGES TO THIS TERMS AND CONDITIONS</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1.	We may update our Terms from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>11	FINAL PROVISIONS</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1.	All disputes arising out of the Terms (including, but not limited to disputes over the invalidity of the Terms, as well as disputes over interpretation and performance of the Terms) shall be settled by mediation.
